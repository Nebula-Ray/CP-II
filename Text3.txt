Machine learning and data science are prominent fields in modern computing.
Processing large datasets is essential for machine learning applications.
Data streams allow efficient processing of data in real-time applications.
Python is often used for data science, but Java is also highly capable in this domain.
With Java, you can handle large datasets and build scalable applications.
The Stream API in Java is a useful tool for data manipulation and filtering.
As machine learning grows, so does the need for efficient data processing tools.
